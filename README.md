### Hi, I'm [Vladimir Traigel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/traigel/)
I'm a developer with experience building SPA using React, Next.js, Node.js, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML&CSS, SCSS... I like to develop applications that bring real value to the end user. Now I am improving my skills in this area and expanding my knowledge with new technologies (Node.js). I spend my free time reading educational literature, as well as improving my English.
